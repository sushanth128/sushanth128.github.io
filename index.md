## What I Do

I build production ML and LLM systems that turn messy operational data into reliable decisions.  
My recent work spans retail recommendation, demand forecasting, and LLM-powered analytics and reporting.

---

## Selected Work

### Agent-Orchestrated Demand Forecasting
*Agentic forecasting system built at Carnegie Mellon*

- **Problem:** Scenario-based demand planning with explainable forecasts.
- **Approach:** Agentic orchestration that combines classical time-series models with LLM reasoning and live data ingestion.
- **Stack:** Python, PyTorch, LLMs, dashboards.
- **Impact:** <5% forecast error in simulation; interactive dashboard for executive planning.

### Retail Recommendation & Churn System (Quantiphi)
*Production ML for 30K+ retail stores*

- **Problem:** Improve category sales and retention across a large CPG footprint.
- **Approach:** Recommendation and churn models in PySpark on AWS, with automated data pipelines.
- **Impact:** 11% sales lift; improved retention KPIs; 35% better data quality and 50% faster deployments.

### LLM Inference Optimization
*Latency-optimized LLM inference for real-time use*

- **Problem:** Reduce inference latency for LLaMA / GPT-style models in constrained environments.
- **Approach:** Speculative decoding and compression (pruning, quantization) with modular benchmarking.
- **Impact:** Significant latency reduction while preserving quality for real-time workloads.

## Art & Creative Work

I also work as an independent artist in digital and traditional media.  
Leading writing and social media teams during undergrad taught me how to present complex ideas clearly and visually.
