![Speculative Decoding](/assets/imgs/grad_ai.jpeg)  
*Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Speculative Decoding*

[Code Repository](https://github.com/sushanth128/LLM-Efficiency-Enhancement)

This project focuses on improving the inference speed of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging speculative decoding. We created a smaller draft model using traditional model compression techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and layer compression, to generate tokens faster. The target LLM then verifies these tokens in parallel, resulting in a significant speedup in the decoding process.

**Key Technologies**:  
- PyTorch
- Large Language Models
